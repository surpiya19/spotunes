# üéß SQL Guidebook: Exploring My Spotify Data

## üîπ Overview
This repo uses the Spotify Web API (via spotipy) to extract data about my playlists, tracks, albums, and artists. (`spotify_data_extract.py`)
The data is stored locally in an SQLite database (spotify.db), allowing me to explore patterns in my own music taste using SQL queries.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Database Setup 

### Design Principles
The schema was designed following relational database principles:
**Normalization:** Separate tables for artists, albums, tracks, playlists, and playlist_tracks to reduce redundancy.
**Primary Keys & Foreign Keys:** Ensure referential integrity. Example: album_id in tracks references albums(album_id).
**Many-to-Many Relationships:** playlist_tracks handles the many-to-many relationship between playlists and tracks.
**Data Types:** Text for names/IDs, integer for popularity and duration, boolean for explicit tracks.

### Data Collection
Data was fetched using Python & Spotify API:
1. spotipy library for authenticated API calls.
2. Fetched 30 playlists, their tracks, albums, and artist information.
3. Stored data in SQLite database (spotify.db).

### Populating the Tables
Data was inserted using a Python script with the Spotify API. Each record includes:
- Artist metadata (name, genre)
- Album info (release date)
- Track details (duration, popularity, explicit)
- Playlist metadata

### ‚´ò Connection Setup
```bash
# Connection to SQLite DB
conn = sqlite3.connect("spotify.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating tables (artists, albums, tracks, playlists, playlist_tracks)
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artists (...)")
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS albums (...)")
# ... other tables ...

# Inserting data using INSERT OR IGNORE to avoid duplicates
cursor.execute("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO tracks (...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)", ...)
```

## How to use this on your own spotify data:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Set .env with your own Spotify credentials. (client_id, client_secret and redirect_url_callback) [for privacy reasons, i have removed the .env file to ensure my credentials don't get exposed.]
3. Run python `spotify_data_extract.py` to populate `spotify.db`.
4. Open spotify.db in any SQL client or use Python sqlite3 to run queries.
5. Explore the queries in queries.sql or the Jupyter Notebook.
